This project has been tested for display responsiveness throughout development. I have tested the site in all display sizes in Chrome Dev Tools, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge and Android devices.

The testing and debugging of this project was done extensively in Chrome Dev Tools throughout the project. The process would typically go as follows:

- Create a function/feature.
- Test that function and try to break the function using unexpected input and having friends and family test the function.
- Fix the bugs.
- Create next function/feature.
- Repeat.
