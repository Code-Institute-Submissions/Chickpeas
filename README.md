# Chickpeas

Chickpeas is my third milestone project while studying at [The Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/).
The purpose of the milestone project is to utilize a database in a website built with a Python Flask project using Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Chickpeas is a cookbook with a focus on the ingredients used in cooking.

## UX

About the site design---

The sites [wireframes](https://github.com/Trevbytes/Keys/blob/master/wireframes/keys-wireframe.pdf) show the original idea for the site. Design changes were made during the consturction of the site to keep the site clean and free from extensive text.

Bright colors and gradients were chosen to engage the user and inspire creativity.

- [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/)

  - The project used **GitPod** as the online IDE/workspace during development .

- [GitHub](https://github)

  - The project uses **GitHub** for hosting the webpage and the repository.
  - In this project I learned how create new branches of a repository for development of the project. The landing page of this project was developed in a seperate branch and then merged with the main branch when finished. A development branch was then created to work out remaining bugs and add the final polish to the project before being submitted for assesment.

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/platform)

  - The project uses **Heroku** for hosting the python app/webpage.

- [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)

  - The project uses **Chrome Developer Tools** for debugging the webpage during development.

- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org)

  - The project uses **W3C Markup Validation** for validating code during development.

- [JShint](https://jshint.com/)

  - The project uses **JShint** for validating and improving JS code during development.

- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)
  - The ReadME used **Am I Responsive** for creating an image of the website on multiple displays to show responsiveness.

## Testing

This project has been tested for display responsiveness throughout development. I have tested the site in all display sizes in Chrome Dev Tools, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge and Android devices.

The testing and debugging of this project was done extensively in Chrome Dev Tools throughout the project. The process would typically go as follows:

- Create a function/feature.
- Test that function and try to break the function using unexpected input and having friends and family test the function.
- Fix the bugs.
- Create next function/feature.
- Repeat.

A testing framework such as [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) was not used as manual user testing was more appropriate for the interactivity required in this project.

This project have been reviewed/tested by an experienced web developer. A mentor provided by Code Institute during my studies.

This project has been peer reviewed/tested within Code Institute's Slack channel.

This project have been reviewed/tested by friends and family. This project has been texted extensively for interactivity.

Some of the main testing of features included:

- Register/Create a new user.
- Create a recipe.
- Edit a recipe.
- Copy a recipe.
- Delete a recipe.
- Create an ingredient.
- Edit an ingredient.
- Delete an ingredient.

- The HTML and CSS code has been validated by [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org) and [JShint](https://jshint.com/)
